# Building-your-Deep-Neural-Network-Step-by-Step
Starting September 2020, notebook items in course shells will become Ungraded Labs. Paid learners will be able to access their notebooks in the new Coursera lab environment; Auditors will lose access. We strongly encourage you to download your notebooks if you are auditing this course. You can also upgrade or applying for financial aid to access premium Lab items in your course. For more information, please see this forum link  Welcome to your third programming exercise of the deep learning specialization. You will implement all the building blocks of a neural network and use these building blocks in the next assignment to build a neural network of any architecture you want. By completing this assignment you will:  - Develop an intuition of the over all structure of a neural network.  - Write functions (e.g. forward propagation, backward propagation, logistic loss, etc...) that would help you decompose your code and ease the process of building a neural network.  - Initialize/update parameters according to your desired structure.   This assignment prepares you well for the upcoming assignment. Take your time to complete it and make sure you get the expected outputs when working through the different exercises. In some code blocks, you will find a "#GRADED FUNCTION: functionName" comment. Please do not modify it. After you are done, submit your work and check your results. You need to score 70% to pass. Good luck :) !
